10/16/2020 Note: 

Canadian ensemble pdt(12) has changed: 500mb -> 5, 850mb ->85
so, create a new code readGB2_CMCE specifically for CMCE and NAEFS
Canadian members arfrom North to South, in grid2grid.f, call cvncep to
convert it. While after verf_g2g_v3.1.1, use copygb2 to convert it
same grid as GEFS (from South to North), so remove 
"call cvncep" in grid2grid. 

This will put a fix to NCO afterward
