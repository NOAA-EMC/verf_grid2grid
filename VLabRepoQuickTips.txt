Be aware of the wiki in the “Virtual Lab” project (https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/redmine/projects/vlab/wiki).  It contains lots of good guidance, including sections devoted to:
* Helping Project Owners
* Repository Management 
* Redmine usage
* and even tips for how to use Eclipse IDE

Some basic repo interactions are listed below.  Note that anything preceded by a “$” represents a variable.

*** Git ****

	clone: (assumes you have setup a 'gerrit' ssh alias -- see https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/redmine/projects/vlab/wiki/Gerrit_Configuration) 

		git clone gerrit:$REPO_NAME

                Alternative is to get the syntax from the project overview at https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/code-review

                git clone ssh://$username@vlab.ncep.noaa.gov:29418/$REPO_NAME

	local commit: 
		git add $FILE_NAME
		git commit -a (for all) OR
		git commit $FILE_NAME(S)

	squash: 
		git rebase -i $BRANCH_NAME~<# of commits to include>
		ex: git rebase -i My_Branch~5

	change branch:
		git checkout $BRANCH_NAME

        create new branch (based upon current checked out branch):
                git checkout -b $NEW_BRANCH_NAME

	commit message keywords:
		VLab Issue #NNNN; fixes #NNNN

	push to gerrit for review: 
		git push gerrit:$REPO_NAME HEAD:refs/for/$BRANCH_NAME
		(alt): git push $DEFINED_REMOTE

        push from local master branch to VLab's master branch without code review:
                git push origin master

        push from local branch to VLab's remote branch:
                git push origin $LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME:$VLAB_REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME

        fetch changes from VLab (does not merge with currently checked out branch):
                git fetch

        pull down changes from VLab and merge within current checked out branch:
                git pull
