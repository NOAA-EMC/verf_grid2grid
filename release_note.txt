1.What are new:

   Transferred from WCOSS to WCOSS2

   Version# from verf_g2g_3.1.4 to verf_g2g_3.2.0 

   Following codes/scripts are updated
  
  (1) In jobs sub-directory
     All jobcard files  are updated by re-setting the test files directory for RUN_ENVIRN=dev

  (2) In sorc sub-directory
     Updated compile_verf_g2g_sorc.sh to re-compile all Fortran source codes

  (3) In modulefiles sub-directory
      Added a new file to load all required modules

  (4) In ush sub-directory
      Updated several scripts to update the path of several utility scripts (wgrib2, copygb2, ndate, etc)

  (5) In parm
      Update environment parameter setting script verf_g2g_prod_config to test canned data and future
       para running data

  (6) Added a new sub-directory version as requied by NCO to set version number

   

2. Implementatioon instruction:

 Run compilation script compile_verf_g2g_sorc.sh in /sorc
  After the compilation, all Fortran executables will be copied into /exec directory

3. Job dependencies 
 Downstream dependencies: 
   None

 Upstream depemdencies:
  GFS, NAM, RAP, HRRR, Hiresw-ARW and Hiresw-NMMB, CMAQ, HISPLT, GEFS, SREF, adn HREF
  AFWA and CLAVR cloud data in /dcom
  NDAS, GDAS, RTMA/URMA, MOSAIC, NESDIS/Smoke/Dust

  All upstream files are grib2 format files

4. Flow chart
  - Access one-day-older (previous day before today)  upstream models and anaylysis data files as listed above 
      located in either /com2 or /dcom directories 
  - Execute  the scripts and Fortran 
  - Output vsdb files and store them in /com/verf/prod/vsdb/grid2grid

5. Test plan
  There is a testing script "test_all.sh" in /ecf/dev directory. Run it will trigger all jobs running
  on personal account and output vsdb files into ptmp directory 
  In /ecf/dev directory, individual job has its own test script. For example
  qsub jverf_grid2grid_cloud_00.ecf 
  which uses PSUB to submit cloud verification job card JVERF_GRID2GRID_CLOUD in jobs directory 
 

6.  Technical details
  The grid2grid verification is a part of VERF, which conducts validation of model grids against analysis grid
in either backward mode (all forecasts except for firewx) and forward mode (firewx). The is a unifed verification
system using same Fortran code (grib2 version) for all model forecasts AND ensemble forecasts. 
  There are several jobs in this grid2grid verification. The single model verification focuses on cloud, reflectivity,
echo-top, visibility, smoke, and dust, while ensemble verification on regular fields like temperature, wind and heights,
etc. In single model verification, each variable has one job card for all models, while ensemble forecast has one job
card for all variables and all ensembels. 
  The output ASCII files are VSDB partial sum recodes. One day one model has one vsdb files. In other word, one vsdb file
has multiple cycles and forecast times VSDB records. If want to see score, some other tools, like METViewer, should
be used to see scores plots.
